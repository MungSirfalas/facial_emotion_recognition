# msc_ai_thesis_fer
Repository for a simple emotion recognition app based on facial expressions. The app was developed as a thesis for my MSc. in Artificial Intelligence degree at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja. 

Given that part of the images utilized to train the classifiers are from private datasets, the complete training dataset utilized for this project has not been published. 

The Ecuadorian Facial Expression (EFE) dataset was collected to increase the number of images in the training dataset. EFE dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cesarron/ecuadorian-facial-expression-efe-dataset.

The folder content description:

- modeling: the Google Colab notebooks are utilized to train different classifiers.
- preprocessing: the Python scripts utilized to create the train, validation, and test sets from the several datasets considered in this work.
- video_capture: the Python script for the emotion recognition app.
