Repository for a simple emotion recognition based on facial expression tool. The app was developed as a thesis project for my MSc. in Artificial Intelligence degree at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja. 

Given that part of the images utilized to train the classifiers are from private datasets, the complete training dataset utilized for this project has not been published. 

Part of the images were taken from the Ecuadorian Facial Expression (EFE) dataset that can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cesarron/ecuadorian-facial-expression-efe-dataset
